## What is it?

Psittacus is an open-source tool meant to facilitate language-learning and teaching, with a vision to empower teachers and learners of any written+spoken language.

It is based on the gamification of the sentence-mining approach, having an interface inspired by that of Duolingo and other competing interactive 
language learning-tools. Psittacus aims at democratizing the process of lesson-preparation, making it easy for teachers to prepare and share their lessons in a standardized and easily accessible format. 

## Whom does it appeal to?

* Language lovers.
* Teachers of any language that need to share quick homeworks/lessons with their students.
* Speakers of endangered languages that wish to preserve and spread their native tounge.
* Conlangers that want the world to learn their language.
* And many more...

## What are some of its main features?
* Easy-to-use interface for teachers to prepare lessons.
* Lessons can be taken fully offline, once sideloaded/prepared.
* Support for audio playback of sentences.
* Support for hover-over-the-word definitions.

  # Name Conflicts
  
   This website is being developed as an SPA (Single Page Application), in light of making it downloadable, with as much    
   functionality as possible available offline. 
  
  Being the final product a single page, means that all html templates have to share the same namespace. The solution 
  currently being adopted to avoid naming conflicts is to have a **UNIQUE ID FOR EACH HTML ELEMENT**.
    
  The convention that will be used in case of a naming conflict (two html elements with the same id) is to prepend the name    
  of the template to the id of the element. 
  
  Eg:
    
   ```
    <!--inside of the file 'take_lesson.html'-->
    <input id="button_play_audio" type="button"/>
      
    <!--Becomes: -->
    <input id="take_lesson_button_play_audio" type="button"/>
     
   ```

  <summary><strong>Setting up a Local Testing Environment</strong></summary>

## 1) Clone this repo
...and navigate to its root directory.

## 2) Create a python virtual environment 
...calling it '.my_env' 

(For gitignore-related reasons).

```
$ python3 -m venv .my_env
```

(You'll be prompted to install the 'venv' module if you don't have it yet).

## 3) Activate the virtual environment:

```
$ source .my_env/bin/activate
```

If this command doesn't work try with:

```
$ . .my_env/bin/activate
```

(You should notice that the console starts displaying the virtual environment's name before your username and the dollar-sign).


## 4) Install this app's dependencies 
... on the virtual environment you just created:

```
(.my_env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 5) Run the app on localhost!

```
(.my_env)$ python3 -m flask run
```

#### Sample output:

```
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
