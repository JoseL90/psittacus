* Add author and lang1-lang2 metadata to lesson json.

* add mechanism to post lessons to server and retrieve them by metadata.

* translate UI with templates

## FOR LATER:

* hover-over-the-word hints for native to target direction as well.
(NOPE, too costly, maybe later. Just show tips on target-lang sentence whenever displayed).

* Allow multiple translations of the same original sentence.
(LATER, too costly right now.)
